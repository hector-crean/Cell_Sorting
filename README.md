# Morphogenesis 



1. CPM_v4_pbc.c++ is the source file for the standard Cellular Potts Model 
 
2. Compile as c++ CPM_v4_pbc.c++ -o CPM_v4_pbc -O3

3. Run as ./CPM_v4_pbc outname(string) Alpha(numeric value) Fraction_stiff_cells(0<f<1)
Example:  ./CPM_v4_pbc out 1 1 
for all cells having stiffness 1

4. Text files with lattice coordinates (x,y), spin id and Alpha are reported in a folder:
Alpha_1/out_t*

5. Text files with position of the centre of mass of the cells is reported in 
Alpha1/com_out and it is in the format 

#t1
CellID x y 
..
CellID x y 

#t2
CellID x y 
..
CellID x y 

...

so plot first frame as
p "com_out" index 0 u 2:3 w p pt 7
the second as
p "com_out" index 1 u 2:3 w p pt 7
and so on..

6. Use load "Plot_movie.plt" in MakeAnimation folder

7. In Analysis folder use ComputeMSD as 
./ComputeMSD ../Alpha1.2/com_out 3000 10 225 60 out
to compute mean squared displ of centre of mass from com_out 
for 275 frames 
with lagtime 10 montecarlo sweeps 
225 cells on a 60x60 grid &
writing on MSD_out.dat
e.g: ./MSD ../Alpha1.4/com_out 270 10 225 60 out



MSD_out.dat contains the average across cells and time in the first block (index 0), which can be plotted as 
p "MSD_out.dat" i 0 u 1:2

Otherwise you can see MSD of each cell by doing
p "MSD_out.dat" i 20 u 1:2
for cell 20 or even
p  for [i=1:225] "MSD_out.dat" index i u 1:2 w l lw 0.5 not , "MSD_out.dat" i 0 w l lw 5 lt -1 title "average MSD"
to show everything 

8. ComputeMSD also creates a file for the Centre of mass "COM_out.dat" which is in the format: 
#Cell id
time cell_id x_pbc y_pbc x_unwrapped y_unwrapped
...

the unwrapped coordinates are used to calculate MSD.


Finally, recall that Ncells=60x60/16=225
where 16 is the typical cell area

§ Background on morphogenesis:
Cells can differentiate into specific cell types that spatially self-organise into tissue architectures. This is achieved by cells communicating, and inducing the expression of proteins, in one-another. In embryology, there is specific interest in how regulatory programs encoded in the DNA of a single fertilized cell can integrate together into the gross organisation of a whole organism. It is still an open question as to how compact DNA programs encode algorithms that allow individual cells to construct complex macrostructures. The acconmpanying code hence involves understanding how genetically encoded algorithms control these individual and collective cell behaviours. Here we reconstruct in silico a ‘toy model’ of cell-cell interactions, attempting to find metrics that correlated with cell self-organisation into multi-layered structures, divergence of genotypically identical cells into distinct types, and symmetry breaking. Computational modelling allows us to track the trajectories of these multi-cellular systems through morphospace (space of forms). Plotting the energy landscape corresponding to each point in the morphospace allows an understanding of stable and meta-stable states in the morphospace, and how tissues transition between them.

While this code is primarily focused on the biological realm, it is equally applicable in studying animal collective behaviours, such as flock formation and sociality of ants, which also arise in the absence of central control, and are generated by local interaction among individual. Within the architectural sphere, morphogenetic programming finds expression in the construction of parametric and generative structures. 


§ Biological detail of implementation 

Cell-to-cell communication networks comprise both intra- and intercellular processes. In order to simplify modelling, intracellular signal transduction networks are generally treated as ‘‘black boxes’’ with specified input-to-output response relationships. This abstracts molecular detail yet still captures essential dynamic properties of the system 

Cells have a cell-specific density of ligands/receptors on their surface. For two adjacent cells, the signalling strength between them is a function of the number of ligands/receptors in contact. Varying degrees of contact are correlated with differing signalling strengths. In the biological realm, furthermore, the response of a cell to this signalling is an integral of the signal strength over time, and so is not just dependent on the instantaneous ligand-receptor contact, but the history of this contact in the recent past. In addition, rather than certain ligand-receptor interactions leading precisely to a morphological outputs, the same ligand-receptor bonding can lead to different outputs, only differentiated by the magnitude of the signal strength as well as the time over which the signalling occurs. For the sake of simplicity, our in silico model will assume a one-to-one correspondence between signalling and a morphological output.

Cell-cell contact dependent signalling can be implemented via a points-based system, where cells gain ‘points’ for having one of its lattice points being in contact with the lattice point of another cell. For this purpose, we can construct an array tracking the ‘heterotrophic boundary length’, for each cell. This comprises a 6 by 225 array, with details of the number of contact points each cell has with other cell types at a given moment. This information can then be used to calculate the point at which a cell has had sufficient stimulation to express cadherin.
An additional concern arises when considering the two methods by which morphological changes are activated: gene inhibition and gene activation. Gene activation, for instance, has 6 main forms (in terms of the biomechanics), relating to how the RNA/DNA polymerase acts. This means that gene activation is often not permanent. If cell A can cause a change in cell B to state B’, B’ can transition back to B after a ‘decay time’, if it does not receive sufficient signalling through binding with cell A’s receptors. The duration of gene activation can be altered by playing with stability of transcription factors. We must therefore also incorporate in our simulation a mechanism whereby cells can transition back to their original state.

While we did incorporate the functionality to control cell switching via heterotopic boundary lengths ,it was decided that the relevant features could be elegantly modelled more simply. During the metropolis step of the CPM, we introduced a ‘gene switch’ step. If the spins of two adjoining lattice points are different (indicating different cell types), a random number between 0-1 is generated. If this is less than the ‘k_on’ number, then cell that the lattice point belongs to will change type. In this way, it simulates the fact that more cell contact with sender cells leads to larger ligand exposure, and so greater probability of a receiver cell changing type. Although it only incorporates information from one timestep, the speed of the simulation is fast.
