# Cell_Sorting




"""
Background:
Cells can differentiate into specific cell types that spatially self-organise into tissue architectures. This is achieved by cells communicating, and inducing the expression of proteins, in one-another. In embryology, there is specific interest in how regulatory programs encoded in the DNA of a single fertilized cell can integrate together into the gross organisation of a whole organism. It is still an open question as to how compact DNA programs encode algorithms that allow individual cells to construct complex macrostructures. The acconmpanying code hence involves understanding how genetically encoded algorithms control these individual and collective cell behaviours. Here we reconstruct in silico a ‘toy model’ of cell-cell interactions, attempting to find metrics that correlated with cell self-organisation into multi-layered structures, divergence of genotypically identical cells into distinct types, and symmetry breaking. Computational modelling allows us to track the trajectories of these multi-cellular systems through morphospace (space of forms). Plotting the energy landscape corresponding to each point in the morphospace allows an understanding of stable and meta-stable states in the morphospace, and how tissues transition between them.

While this code is primarily focused on the biological realm, it is equally applicable in studying animal collective behaviours, such as flock formation and sociality of ants, which also arise in the absence of central control, and are generated by local interaction among individual. Within the architectural sphere, morphogenetic programming finds expression in the construction of parametric and generative structures.
